[mailbox][] free–ios currently only works for google mail accounts; great way of clearing your inbox, as it uses swipe actions to sort and move messages into the three categories I use: (a) to do, (b) to keep, (c) to wait. I use a similar system with email on my laptop by setting keyboard maestro shortcuts for the three categories that are restricted to the email program (F10 -> a, F11 -> b , F12 -> c, all conveniently located near the delete button; also cmd–F09 -> view inbox, cmd–F10 -> view folder a etc. NB this is easy in Thunderbird, as you can specify to move to or view folders, but Apple Mail workaround is to use favourite folders (drag and drop into favourites bar) and then use keyboardmaestro macros to activate standard favourite folders shortcuts… outcome is that you can hide your mailbox tree pane if you no longer need it.)
