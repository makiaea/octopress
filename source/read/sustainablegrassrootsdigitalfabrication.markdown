## Abstract
Digital fabrication can be sustainable and inclusive in so far as it addresses issues of ecology and equality. Drawing from many perspectives including deep ecology and ecofeminism, we critically analyse grassroots digital fabrication through whole–systems approaches and propose general, scalable strategies to enable sustainability and inclusion.

This research may be new and unique in that we will approach sustainability and inclusion (and innovation) as emergent properties of systems, that scalability is included as an integral part of long–term success of those systems, that effective transmission of knowledge is a key focus, and that practical, scalable solutions will be proposed not only by innovation but also by confounding common obstacles.

## Sustainable
Currently sustainability is often defined as anthropocentric sustainability, that is, the stewardship of resources passed on to future generations of humans. I propose a more ecocentric and inclusive approach to sustainability, with influences from deep ecology and ecofeminism (Devall and Sessions 1985, Mellor 1992, Lam and Hayashi 2008). I will approach sustainability as an emergent property, something that emerges from a pattern of thought and actions rather than a corporeal metric.

Even if we use a conventional metric of sustainability, one can readily criticise current digital fabrication on sustainability grounds. Base materials are expensive and mostly unrecyclable, very few people have the technical knowledge to operate the fabrication facilities well, and the products are mostly far from sustainable. However, we should bear in mind when criticising digital fabrication that the current state of affairs is similar to that of the bicycle in the age of the Penny Farthing, or that of aerospace engineering before the Wright brothers' invention of three–axis control.

Nevertheless, "criticism without rejection" allows us to envision how sustainability might be improved.

## Grassroots
We will be focusing at the scale of local, inclusive digital fabrication (e.g. 3D printing at makerbot level, hackerspaces in communities), rather than institution–scale digital fabrication (e.g. aerospace manufacturing). I would also like to explore the question of how local fabrication can scale sustainably to general fabrication not via institutionalisation but via open–source distribution to many local groups (the "local–general transition").

Inclusivity is often politically charged, for example at UCSD and other University of California campuses, the practice of so–called "positive discrimination" to increase minority participation is heavily discussed and debated. Current digital fabrication is often portrayed as dominated by affluent white males. While acknowledging the physical fact of current numbers, we reject that this necessarily leads to dominance. Discrimination (whether active or economic) in digital fabrication is no more (and no less) than discrimination in society in general. The key is that digital fabrication, like education, can be a force–multiplier for equality when minorities have access.

I hope to analyse scalable pathways to increasing inclusivity. For example cost–reduction (e.g. of 3D printers, materials) and "generalisability of methods" (e.g. to aid local–general transition) may be scalable but grants or prizes (awarded by selection or competition) may not be scalable.

In addition, I believe we cannot rely on "progress" from institutions – this is not to say that institutions cannot make or contribute to progress, just that in an institutionalised setting there can be major obstacles to progress (for example, transaction costs: Coase 1937, Shirky 2008). Those major obstacles can hinder or even reverse progress towards sustainable goals, especially if realisation of those goals would render the institution superfluous in its current state. This can be a result of inability to change within the organisation, which may arise from the individual inability to change or really understand change (Lam and Hayashi 2008). This leaves crucial innovation to be done by the grassroots, the very grassroots that may grow best through increased inclusivity and diversity.

One intriguing possibility is that ecological sustainability is below the Coasean floor of institutional action. One way to bypass this obstacle might be to create platforms that enable emergent sustainability.

## Innovation
My current perspective on innovation is as an emergent property from cross–boundary "combination" and incremental advance.

I agree with the hypothesis in Ronald Burt's "Structural Holes and Good Ideas" (Burt 2004), but do not agree that the evidence fully supports the hypothesis. The paper studies managers in a hierarchy and bases value judgement on two senior managers' evaluation of whether ideas are good; and claims generality of "hypothesis that people who live in the intersection of social worlds are at higher risk of having good ideas" when he is actually evaluating the ability of individual managers in a hierarchy to "impress" higher managers with ideas – ideas that are not applied or tested except via the evaluation of the two senior managers. Indeed, "there is little evidence of managers acting on their ideas." (Burt 2004).

Nonetheless, I believe it reasonable to say that enabling cross–boundary combination may be a key pathway to increasing innovation – for example by increasing inclusivity to create diverse groups which have greater flexibility and range of experience, increasing the likelihood of the members applying principles from their "home range" disciplines and experience.

## Digital fabrication
Digital fabrication is not only physical 3D–printing or hackerspaces, which epitomise "fabrication", but also digital transmission of innovative ideas, instruction, recommendation and learning. 

Innovative ideas are emerging that may have great potential for sustainability, made possible by 3D–printing, including in–situ printing of hinges (e.g. [n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com](http://www.n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com)), direct carbon/kevlar fibre composite printing (e.g. [markforged.com](http://www.markforged.com)), titanium bicycle frame printing ([renishaw.com](http://www.renishaw.com)), and solar sintering ([markuskayser.com](http://www.markuskayser.com)).

The in–situ printing of hinges can effectively increase the size of a 3D–printer; this is possible because large, low–volume objects can be "pre–folded" into a compact space that fits the volume of a 3D–printer. One example is Nervous System's "kinematics" process, currently being used to print jewelry and dresses, which could be used in future for large structures (in metal, for example).

Direct composite printing and direct metal printing could be used to produce composites and forms currently laborious to create, extending the possible "use–space".

If digital fabrication creates demand for extra goods, and the goods are themselves unsustainable, then unsustainable consumption increases. However, some commentators maintain that eventually the replacement of unsustainable manufacturing, freight, storage and retail with (slightly) less unsustainable digital fabrication will be a net sustainability gain.

Similarly, extending the use–life of existing objects and systems by fabricating replacement parts is sustainable, but currently 3D–printed replacement parts are of questionable value, i.e. inappropriate materials for the use case, high opportunity cost; in future it may well be possible to do the same with a much–reduced opportunity cost (especially through local grassroots makerspaces) and appropriate materials.

Materials development is essential but currently mostly proprietary and closed–source. Various companies can print ceramic, chocolate, salt, concrete, cellulose (e.g. [emergingobjects.com](http://emergingobjects.com)). Open–source sharing of materials methods could catalyse sustainable fabrication, by enabling the use of appropriate and sustainable materials.

Improving basic instruction and transmission of information is viewed as unglamorous and unrewarding, but actually has a great impact on sustainability and inclusion. Peter Asaro, in his paper "Transforming society by transforming technology: the science and politics of participatory design." (Asaro 2000) noted:

"An entire sub-discipline of systems design called the “Ethnography of Information Systems” has emerged which identifies the role of the systems designer, or at least one role of a member of a design team, as being fundamentally that of an anthropologist — to produce a representation of the practices of a work culture which can be used as a basis for systems design."

In the literature on digital fabrication I have come across, in so far as it deals with transmission of knowledge, largely deals with the topic from the perspectives of power relations, or "more is better", rather than the effectiveness of physical transmission of knowledge. This is not to say that power relations and low quantity are not a major obstacle to knowledge transmission, but that they are not the only major obstacle.

## General, scalable strategies
Scalability, is here defined as the practical application of a local or small–scale solution to distributed or wide–scale implementation.

The scalability of a strategy depends crucially on how well we understand the whole system. Thus we will be using principles from a wide range of disciplines, including cognitive psychology (e.g. framing, anchoring, Kahneman 2011), philosophy of power (Illich 1970, 1973, 1977, Lam and Hayashi 2008), economics (Galbraith 1954, 1958, 1967, Schumacher 1973), and other systems approaches (Odum 1981, Lovelock 2005, Mollison 1988, Taleb 2007).

The "confounding obstacles" approach (Lam and Hayashi 2008) argues that, within the limits of what we can account for (Taleb 2007), the most effective way to make headway is to develop and implement strategies to surmount major obstacles.

Thus we will investigate the major obstacles in digital fabrication not only to sustainability and inclusion, but also scalability, and develop strategies to bypass them. These obstacles might include, for example, cognitive biases, power relations in society, and basic physical limits.

## Generalisation of methods
Good instructions are rare, because it is rare for people to write instructions, because it is rare for people to write instructions with long–term replicability in mind, and because they are very rarely generalisable. By their nature, instructions are static unless maintained, thus they will lose applicability with time. Our proposed framework faces the same constraints.

Aside from frequent maintenance, one other major method to creating useful instructions is to improve their "generalisability", that is, how readily they can be applied in slightly different, or even very different conditions. The key is to explain the intent to the reader, so that if the listed methods are not available or applicable, they can be replaced, ignored or updated.

## Enabling sustainability: a micro case–study
Digital fabrication, even grassroots digital fabrication, is unlikely to be sustainable, in the strict ecological sense, for some time to come. But it can certainly make our society less unsustainable in a much shorter timeframe. By viewing sustainability as an emergent property, rather than a goal that can be produced, mandated or imposed, it is easier to see why this can be. 

In a nutshell, grassroots digital fabrication can enable the implementation of sustainable technologies. For example, let us consider the "starstream" — an ultrasonic transducer and bubble generator held in a stream of water, that effectively cleans surfaces because the frequency of the ultrasound projected down the free flowing stream of water is tuned to the size of the bubbles, which is also tuned to the size of the micro–fissures in the surface, allowing bubble cavitation to release energy directly at the site of contamination.

For more details of the starstream, see the [Southampton University Starstream project](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/projects/starstream.page#overview) page, the Royal Society [case study](http://royalsociety.org/grants/case-studies/tim-leighton) and [Brain Mercer award details](http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/grants/labs-to-riches/2012/Tim%20Leighton%20v2.pdf)

This technology has potential to reduce the volume of water required for cleaning "by a factor of five or more", and the reduced need for surfactants or other additives or heat can mean that the water is also more easily reused, cleaned and recycled. This has clear advantages for sustainability in reducing water use, reducing additive use, reducing energy use, as well as expanding the use–space for water–based cleaning.

You may have noticed, if you search for information on the technology, that concrete information is hard to find, and that scientific papers on the technology are not readily available (e.g. the most relevant–seeming that I have found so far, Offin et al. 2008, is not actually directly relevant). The inventors (Prof Tim Leighton, Dr Peter Birkin, Dr Doug Offin, University of Southampton) may be reserving the technology for commercial purposes. Others may be able to reverse–engineer the patented technology, now that they know it exists. Be that as it may, imagine if such a technology was created and released to the world as open source or creative commons.

The key is that the few complex parts that cannot be easily manufactured by digital fabrication can be obtained relatively readily via conventional fabrication (e.g. ultrasonic transducer, wiring), while large quantities of physical resources (e.g. water, surfactants, heat, electricity) are replaced by a relatively small device and process (transducer, wiring, control mechanism, electricity).

Once the technology is released, grassroots digital fabrication can then distribute this innovation across the world, in far less time and also to many areas slow to be served (or never served) by conventional manufacturing. This might occur by "kickstarter"–style manufacturing, or simply production of kits of essential parts that are complemented by local digital fabrication. Not only this, but once many people can access this technology, they now have the chance to collaboratively innovate to improve it. This is the real promise of grassroots digital fabrication, not production of sustainable products, but the enabling of a society that can innovate to sustainability itself.

On the other hand, is the possible destruction of entire industries, rendering people unemployable, balanced against the eventual rise of new industries and the employment they generate? Is this sustainable?

Considering the impact of starstream–based technology on the washing–machine industry alone, while mass–produced garment washing machines based on ultrasonics may displace conventional washing–machines, they would still be likely mass–produced. Whether it is the current dominant firms that do the production in the future will be dependent upon their trajectory in innovation. Grassroots digital fabrication is unlikely to displace this form of manufacturing for some time – at this point it easier to see that automated mass digital fabrication could have severe impacts on conventional production. Where grassroots impact may be felt is in the innovation space, catalysing innovation from entrepreneurs and collaborators, and in expanding the use–space for the technology to places underserved by conventional production. The downstream effect of sustainable innovation is our emergent goal of sustainability, via reduced use of resources, in this case water, additives and energy.
