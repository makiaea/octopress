**based on maki's handwriting** start of a basic font using fontforge — originally designed in 1995–6 for ambidextrous pen–and–ink.

**current status** 20120219 contains A–Z, a-z, 0–9 and some punctuation. Some accented characters (auto–generated by fontforge) are available, but we haven't yet had time to optimise their positions on the letters. Of special interest to font designers is that there are no kerning pairs or ligatures as the font is designed to work without them.

**testing summary** 20120219 tested using MacOS 10.8 mountain lion preview. Embedding the font via an externally hosted url link in webpages (using @fontface) works for Mac Safari 5.2 and iOS 5.0.1 but fails gracefully for firefox 10.0.2 and internet explorer 9 due to incomplete external fonts support.
