I am passionate about love (e.g. friendship, connection), trust (e.g. against corruption, deceit), and responsibility (e.g. against concentration of power, abuse, slavery, ecocide).

I also study learning, change, and communication; for example understanding how we are bound by our habits, beliefs and language to certain courses of action, and how to move beyond those bounds.

Let's be great friends and companions!

lots of love, maki xx
